          Hi! My name is Charlotte Rios. I'm a Web Development student at Collin College. Welcome to my Semester Project
          for Web Design Tools. Initially, I chose this course as an elective in my first semester because, as a transfer
          student, I didn't need to take any GenEd courses. I figured, "Eh, why not take a design course to go along with
          my development courses? Surely, it will be useful at some point in my career!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know what to expect from this course. I don't have the eye to be a designer, but developers need to be
          able to match the mock-ups sent over by the design team. I've always been fascinated by the folks who can use
          Photoshop like a pro, so when I realized I would be learning Photoshop, I was excited.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoyed this course a lot and learned so much! I'm definitely not an old pro with Photoshop, nor do I expect I
          ever will be, but I've learned how to do some pretty great stuff. I've even learned how to do some things
          friends of mine who are in web didn't know how to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find six examples of the work I completed across this semester's course neatly organized on my site.
          You will find the original image, a blurb about my edits, and my finished image for each example of my work.
