        Lab 1 -- Photoshop Basics
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this lab, since it was our first, I needed to choose a photo that was either mine or public domain.  
        I then needed to select a significant part of the image to crop and keep as my new image.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time I'd ever used Photoshop.  I chose a photo my husband took of his Ford Mustang.  I 
        used the Crop tool to do a simple crop, removing as much as possible from the picture unrelated to the 
        Mustang.  I cropped out the mailbox to the right and the entirety of the house above the car.  This brought 
        the Mustang into the main focus of the new picture.  I found that using Photoshop was easier than I expected.
