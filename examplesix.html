        Lab 5 -- Creating a Poster
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this lab, I had to create my poster using at least one photo or original drawing made in Photoshop, 
        at least two vector shapes, and two text blocks/areas to create my poster message.  The theme of the 
        poster was my choice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to make a poster to bring awareness to the most endangered sea turtle in the world, the Kemp's 
        Sea turtle.  The Kemp's Sea turtle lays eggs on South Padre Island, Texas, just south of Corpus Christi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a photograph I took at the Texas State Aquarium of a sea turtle as the background of my poster.  
        I then made two vector images - one of the yellow flag with a black silhouette of a sea turtle that they 
        use to mark buried sea turtle eggs that were laid and a map of South Padre Island.  I included text that 
        I warped and applied a filter to so that it draws your attention.  This was my favorite assignment, and 
        I had a lot of fun making my poster!
