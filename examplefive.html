        Lab 3 -- Fixes & Corrections
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this lab, I needed to choose a photo to correct the lighting or contrast.  I was to use the Levels, 
        Curves, Histogram, Shadows/Highlights, and other correction adjustments to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to color-correct a picture of the graduation cake I made for my niece.  The cake was a combination 
        of a Wall-E and a galaxy theme.  The photo was very dark, so the galaxy colors didn't appear.  To fix this, 
        I used the Brightness/Contrast tool to turn up the brightness and turn down the contrast.  I used the Object 
        Selection tool to select the cake, created a new Adjustment Layer, and adjusted the Hue and Saturation.  I 
        then started another Adjustment Layer and changed the Brightness and Contrast.  I then used the Spot Healing 
        tool on the Background layer to remove some frosting spots I missed during cake assembly from the cake board.  
        I was super excited about how this came out!
